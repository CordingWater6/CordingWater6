I don't really write stuff but hey, I'm CordingWater6, a 22 year old music technology student from England. 

I'm planning on learning coding languages to then apply it to music, which means being able to publish that code online to get help as well as help others is super
important to me. If that makes any sense. The languages will be varied and oddly specific to certain applications, but it should all hopefully be useful.

The language I currently know is SuperCollider, however there are plans to just go into others, such as Python, C# and more.
